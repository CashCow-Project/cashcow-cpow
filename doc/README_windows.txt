Intro
-----
CashCow is a free open source project derived from BlackCoin and Bitcoin, with the goal
of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.  CashCow introduces a new
staking reward system to increase incentive for CashCow holders to actively stake coins,
helping to secure the CashCow network.  It should serve as a proof of concept for other
Proof of Stake coins to consider this new reward system.  Built on the foundation of
Bitcoin, Peercoin, NovaCoin, and BlackCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake help
further advance the field of crypto-currency.
